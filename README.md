# robot-ADVKit-ArcadeDrive-AbishtasVersion
Creating a tank drive for 9105 Armstrong, using advantage scope for telemetry.
This was forked from Jackson's tank drive and the cansparkmax is all his work :)

Robot model files and configs are here (v1): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nj5jI0e5juz05X9ePxJ-Sxwzd5aHrD4J/view?usp=sharing
Uncompress them and put them in teh userAssets folder in the advantage scope folder
