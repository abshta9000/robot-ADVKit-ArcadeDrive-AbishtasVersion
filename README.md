# robot-ADVKit-ArcadeDrive-AbishtasVersion
Creating a tank drive for 9105 Armstrong, using advantage scope for telemetry.
This was forked from Jackson's tank drive and the CANSparkMax drive io is all his work :)

Robot model files and configs are here (v3): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ecwO6oaOaxFcwbGZm-0RWd1hlSmhZmtD/view?usp=sharing
Uncompress them and put them in the userAssets folder in the advantage scope folder, more info on this page: https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/AdvantageScope/blob/main/docs/CUSTOM-ASSETS.md
